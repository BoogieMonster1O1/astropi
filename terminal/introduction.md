# Introduction

The terminal is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with a computer using text commands. It's a great way to perform tasks more efficiently.

## Prerequisites

### Windows
Windows 11 ships with Windows Terminal. However, Windows Terminal only supports Powershell and Command Prompt by default. As such, you will need to install a Linux distribution to use the terminal as described in this guide.

It is recommended to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run a Linux distribution on Windows. To install, run PowerShell as an administrator and execute the following command:

```bash
wsl --install
```

Once complete, you should now be able to open an Ubuntu terminal from Windows Terminal.

### macOS
macOS comes with an app called Terminal. You can find it in the Applications folder under Utilities.

### Linux
Most Linux distributions come with a terminal emulator installed by default. You can access it by searching for "Terminal" in the application menu.
