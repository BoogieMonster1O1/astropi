## Humble Beginnings

As three days of meticulous testing comes to an end, here's a summary of everything we've done so far, and everything that's going to be done moving forward, in astrophotography.

Astrophotography was first announced over three months ago - a brand new project from the Optical Vertical. It's now one of the most buzzing projects at dhRuVa. But it wasn't always this way. We went from knowing nothing about astrophotography, to building a working prototype that can take pictures, videos, and even stream a live preview on the internet!

## What have we done?

A lot.

1. **We set up a Raspberry Pi Camera**  
The heart of this operation is the Raspberry Pi and camera. The first few days were entirely spent in figuring out the Raspberry Pi - something that was new for all of us.
