# Important Instructions

Read the following instructions carefully before using the Raspberry Pi and the camera module.

## Raspberry Pi
- The Raspberry Pi needs a minimum of 15 W power supply. A 5 V, 3 A power supply will work. If the red LED on the Raspberry Pi is blinking, it means the power supply is not sufficient.
- If the green LED on the Raspberry Pi is blinking, it means the SD card is being accessed. Do not remove the SD card while the green LED is blinking.
- If using an ethernet cable, make sure the lights on the ethernet port are blinking. If not, try a different cable or troubleshoot the network connection.
- The Raspberry Pi may take *up to 2 minutes* to boot up. Be patient ™️
- The Raspberry Pi will get hot during operation. It is normal for the temperature to rise to 50-60°C. If the temperature exceeds 80°C, the Raspberry Pi will throttle the CPU to prevent overheating. Full throttling will occur at 85°C and can significantly reduce performance.

## Camera Module
- To insert the camera module, gently lift the tabs on the camera connector, insert the camera module connector, and push the tabs back down for a snug fit.
- You will need to restart the Raspberry Pi after connecting the camera module.
