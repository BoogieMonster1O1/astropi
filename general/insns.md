# Important Instructions

Read the following instructions carefully before using the Raspberry Pi and the camera module.

## Raspberry Pi
1. The Raspberry Pi needs a minimum of 15 W power supply. A 5 V, 3 A power supply will work. If the red LED on the Raspberry Pi is blinking, it means the power supply is not sufficient.
2. If the green LED on the Raspberry Pi is blinking, it means the SD card is being accessed. Do not remove the SD card while the green LED is blinking.
3. If using an ethernet cable, make sure the lights on the ethernet port are blinking. If not, try a different cable or troubleshoot the network connection.
4. The Raspberry Pi *may take up to 90 seconds* to boot up. Be patient ™️.
5. The Raspberry Pi will get hot during operation. It is normal for the temperature to rise to 50-60°C. If the temperature exceeds 80°C, the Raspberry Pi will throttle the CPU to prevent overheating. Full throttling will occur at 85°C and can significantly reduce performance.

## Camera Module
1. To insert the camera module, gently lift the tabs on the camera connector, insert the camera module connector, and push the tabs back down for a snug fit.
2. You will need to restart the Raspberry Pi after connecting the camera module.
